        "abstract": "This study investigated whether increased attention to the central or peripheral visual feld can reduce motion sickness in virtual reality (VR). A recent study found that increased attention to the periphery during vection was correlated with lower self-reported motion sickness susceptibility, which suggests that peripheral attention might be benefcial for avoiding cybersickness. We tested this experimentally by manipulating visual attention to central vs. peripheral felds during VR exposure. We also measured attention to the periphery during vection and motion sickness susceptibility to attempt to replicate the previous results. In Experiment 1, task-relevant cues to target locations were provided in the central or peripheral feld during navigation in VR, and we found no diferences in motion sickness. In Experiment 2, attention to the center or periphery was manipulated with a dot-probe task during passive VR exposure, and we found that motion sickness was greater in the condition that required attention to the periphery. In both experiments, there was no correlation between baseline attentional allocation and self-reported motion sickness susceptibility. Our results demonstrate that restricting attention to the central visual feld can decrease cybersickness, which is consistent with previous fndings that cybersickness is greater with large FOV.",

        "abstract": " Virtual reality (VR) technologies are used in a diverse range of applications. Many of these involve an embodied conversational agent (ECA), a virtual human who exchanges information with the user. Unfortunately, VR technologies remain inaccessible to many users due to the phenomenon of cybersickness: a collection of negative symptoms such as nausea and headache that can appear when immersed in a simulation. Many factors are believed to affect a user's level of cybersickness, but little is known regarding how these factors may influence a user's opinion of an ECA. In this study, we examined the effects of virtual stairs, a factor associated with increased levels of cybersickness. We recruited 39 participants to complete a simulated airport experience. This involved a simple navigation task followed by a brief conversation with a virtual airport customs agent in Spanish. Participants completed the experience twice, once walking across flat hallways, and once traversing a series of staircases. We collected self-reported ratings of cybersickness, presence, and perception of the ECA. We additionally collected physiological data on heart rate and galvanic skin response. Results indicate that the virtual staircases increased user level's of cybersickness and reduced their perceived realism of the ECA, but increased levels of presence.",

        "abstract": "Immersion into a virtual environment (VE) often results in adverse symptoms including nausea, dizziness, and disorientation. These symptoms are an indicator of cybersickness, which is a condition similar to motion sickness experienced in VEs. In this paper, we hypothesized that administered cognitive distraction can accelerate the rate of habituation to a VE. This acceleration, therefore, can lower severity of cybersickness in fewer amount of immersions. To evaluate the impact of cognitive distraction on reducing the effects of cybersickness, we designed a VE and carried out a human subject study with control and experimental groups created through stratified random sampling. Subjects were immersed in our VE on four separate sessions, and our experimental group received cognitive distraction throughout the immersions. Cybersickness was measured using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and Presence Questionnaire (PQ). Upon comparing the average SSQ subgroups nausea, oculomotor, and disorientation scores reported by participants for each immersion session, we observed that our experimental group exhibited decrease in cybersickness to a greater extent than that of our control group. We completed t-tests for each of these comparisons, to find that these results are statistically insignificant. We plan to continue with this work by incorporating up to 30 total participants to clarify these findings.",

        "abstract": "This work addresses cybersickness, a major barrier to successful long-exposure immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences since user discomfort frequently leads to prematurely ending such experiences. Starting from sensory conflict theory, we posit that if a vibrating floor delivers vestibular stimuli that minimally match the vibration characteristics of a scenario, the size of the conflict between the visual and vestibular senses will be reduced and, thus, the incidence and/or severity of cybersickness will also be reduced. We integrated a custom-built, computer-controlled vibrating floor in our VR system. To evaluate the system, we implemented a realistic off-road vehicle driving simulator in which participants rode multiple laps as passengers on an off-road course. We programmed the floor to generate vertical vibrations similar to those experienced in real off-road vehicle travel. The scenario and driving conditions were designed to be cybersickness-inducing for users in both the Vibration and No-vibration conditions. We collected subjective and objective data for variables previously shown to be related to levels of cybersickness or presence. These included presence and simulator sickness questionnaires (SSQ), self-rated discomfort levels, and the physiological signals of heart rate, galvanic skin response (GSR), and pupil size.

        "abstract": "We present an efficient locomotion technique that can reduce cybersickness through aligning the visual and vestibular induced self-motion illusion. Our locomotion technique stimulates proprioception consistent with the visual sense by intentional head motion, which includes both the head\u2019s translational movement and yaw rotation. A locomotion event is triggered by the hand-held controller together with an intended physical head motion simultaneously. Based on our method, we further explore the connections between the level of cybersickness and the velocity of self motion through a series of experiments. We first conduct Experiment 1 to investigate the cybersickness induced by different translation velocities using our method and then conduct Experiment 2 to investigate the cybersickness induced by different angular velocities. Our user studies from these two experiments reveal a new finding on the correlation between translation/angular velocities and the level of cybersickness. The cybersickness is greatest at the lowest velocity using our method, and the statistical analysis also indicates a possible U-shaped relation between the translation/angular velocity and cybersickness degree. Finally, we conduct Experiment 3 to evaluate the performances of our method and other commonly-used locomotion approaches, i.e., joystick-based steering and teleportation. The results show that our method can significantly reduce cybersickness compared with the joystick-based steering and obtain a higher presence compared with the teleportation. These advantages demonstrate that our method can be an optional locomotion solution for immersive VR applications using commercially available HMD suites only.",

        "abstract": " Cybersickness is a type of motion sickness that may occur during a virtual reality (VR) experience. Many studies have proposed solutions to mitigate cybersickness, while navigating a virtual environment with controllers or walking over a floor. However, reducing the levels of cybersickness while physically walking on an omnidirectional treadmill has been largely overlooked. In this article, we performed a within-subject study, where 34 novice participants underwent four visual conditions while walking in a virtual maze over an omnidirectional treadmill. In the control condition, the movement speed was reduced of the half compared to a standard navigation speed, a movement speed smoothing was added, and the user\u2019s virtual body was represented. The other three conditions changed one of the visual parameters of the control condition: in the standard speed condition, the speed reduction was not performed; for the no smoothing condition, the smoothing was not performed; and for the no avatar condition, the user\u2019s avatar was removed. Results showed that the standard speed condition was reported to induce a significant level of cybersickness compared to the control and no avatar conditions. Nevertheless, standard speed was also the condition most preferred to navigate a virtual environment. This suggests the need to find a tradeoff between the easiness to move quickly in a virtual environment and the cybersickness that can be induced. We provide a discussion of the obtained results and their implications for the design of VR experiences while users walk upon an omnidirectional treadmill.",

In this article, we present a set of algorithms to mitigate VR sickness that dynamically modulate the user's field of view by modifying the contrast of the periphery based on movement, color, and depth. In contrast with previous work, this vision modulator is a shader that is triggered by specific motions known to cause VR sickness, such as acceleration, strafing, and linear velocity. Moreover, the algorithm is governed by delta velocity, delta angle, and average color of the view. We ran two experiments with different washout periods to investigate the effectiveness of dynamic modulation on the symptoms of VR sickness, in which we compared this approach against a baseline and pitch-black field-of-view restrictors. Our first experiment made use of a just-noticeable-sickness design, which can be useful for building experiments with a short washout period.",

        "abstract": "It is known that human influential factors (HIFs) such as the sense of presence, immersion, attention, stress, and engagement levels play a crucial role in the gamer\u2019s perceived immersive media experience. To this end, recent research has explored the use of affective brain-/body-computer interfaces to monitor such factors. Typically, studies have been conducted in laboratory settings and have relied on research-grade neurophysiological sensors. Transferring the obtained knowledge to everyday settings, however, is not straightforward, especially since it requires cumbersome and long preparation times, which could be overwhelming for gamers. To overcome this limitation, we have recently developed an instrumented VR headset which directly embeds a number of dry ExG sensors (electroencephalography, EEG; electrocardiography, ECG; and electrooculography, EOG) into the head-mounted display (termed iHMD). More recently, we have also developed a companion software to allow for use and monitoring of the device at the gamer's home with minimal experimental supervision, hence exploring its potential use truly \u201cin the wild\u201d. The iHMD, VR controllers, and two laptops, along with a copy of the Half-Life: Alyx videogame were dropped off at the homes of eight gamers who consented to participate in the study. All public health COVID-19 protocols were followed, including sanitizing the iHMD in a UV-C light chamber and with sanitizing wipes 48h prior to dropping the equipment off. Instructions on how to set up the equipment and the game, as well as a google form with a questionnaire to be answered after the game with questions related to user experience were provided via videoconference. The researcher remained available remotely to monitor signal quality and in case any participant questions arose, but otherwise, researcher interventions were minimal. The participants were asked to play the game for around 1.5 hours. This paper details the obtained results from this study and shows the potential of measuring HIF metrics from ExG signals collected \u201cin the wild,\u201d as well as their use in remote gaming experience monitoring. In particular, we will show the potential of measuring gamer sense of presence, immersion, and emotion from the collected signals. The next steps will be to use these signals and inferred HIF metrics to adjust the game in real-time, thus maximizing the user experience for each individual gamer",

Researchers have attempted to discover the possible fundamental causes of cybersickness for years. Despite the longstanding interest in the research field, inconsistent results have been drawn on the contributing factors and solutions to combating cybersickness. Moreover, little attention has been paid to individual susceptibility. A consolidated explanation remains under development, requiring more empirical studies with robust and reproducible methodologies. This review presents an integrated survey connecting the findings from previous review papers and the state of the art involving empirical studies and participants. A literature review is then presented, focusing on the practical studies of different contributing factors, the pros and cons of measurements, profiles of cybersickness, and solutions to reduce this phenomenon. Our findings suggest a lack of considerations regarding user susceptibility and gender balance in between groups studies. In addition, incongruities among empirical findings raised concerns. We conclude by suggesting points of insights for future empirical investigations.",
